# My Dev Notes, yo!

## Add a JS component

* Install using bower
* Reference in config.yml (it'll be in bower_components)

## Waypoints

The waypoints jquery plugin wouldnâ€™t work when I tried to declare an offset (uit always happend in the middle of the page instead of the bottom). It was <main> main had a display: block; that was related to normalize or something. Setting the tagret elemnts to display: inline; FIXED IT!!!
