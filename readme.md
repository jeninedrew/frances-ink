# [Frances Ink](https://frances.ink/) 

Check out the [case study](https://frances.ink/portfolio/frances-ink.html).

## Summary

Frances Ink's portfolio site is built with the help of Foundation, a front-end framework, and a little bit of jQuery.

The focus is on a clean presentation and improved performance. Using Sass and the BEM methodology along with semantic HTML5 resulted in improved code. Relying on Gulp made development a breeze.

## ZURB Template

The ZURB Template for use with [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites) is a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with Panini
- Sass compilation and prefixing
- JavaScript concatenation
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- For production builds:
  - CSS compression
  - JavaScript compression
  - Image compression

## Lazy Load Plugin for JQuery

[Lazy Load](https://appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/) delays loading of images.

- Makes the page load faster
- Potentially reduces server load

## Getting Started

For development, using [Foundation CLI](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli)...

```bash

```
To create a production build...

```bash
