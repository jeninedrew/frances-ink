          <span class="intro">Jenine Drew leads Frances Ink. </span> After building the website for her family’s land development company, Jenine decided she loved coding and made the leap, starting Frances Ink as a side project while continuing to operate heavy equipment during the day.

          All these years later, Frances Ink is a going concern and Jenine wears sweat pants instead of Carhartts (she works from home).
