								A <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8">Drupal 8</a> theme integrated with <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a>, a module design system. Ideas: 1) modular design makes the site easy to maintain, even wth multiple designerc contributing to the dite. INTERATING Pattern Lab with Drupal means it's east ot maintain, making it painless for multile designers to contribute. 2) 
</p>
<p>
								So, easy to maintain and flexible,.. one place to update that integrates with drupal, automatically updating designs across the entire site. 

								1) Modular and Integrated Design System
								2) Improving the performace and zaccessibility with Drupal 8's improvred theme layer and my own focus with the pattern lab making it easier.

					<h3>Modular Design System</h3>

					<div class="medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-12 large-offset-0 end columns words--double--article">
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								Intrroduce Pattern Lab and modulare design ideas, separate from the implimentation, just the idea.
							</p>
							<p>
								Improved Collaboration (all the various designers working on the same projects and integratign other sites they maintained). <-- Now say why it's important to this project in particular.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								The balsamiq mockup to identify structure?? Or components, layout...
							</p>
							<p>
								after the Balsamiq, then show images stacked in a 3 column layout (or throw in a flexbox thing....showing various designed compnents...Maybe include a pattern Lab full page pic for content. Another gif? <-- Eh, maybe just pics. Better uses for gifs. Should the gif have a play button? Is that not a gif anymore?

					</div>

					<p>
						Maybe mke the backgrounds white or transparent so the compnents stick out in thin air? Or I can include the atual HTML/CSS and center 'em all? Include images of the componnts? If relevant...and an image in regular layout (the page view).
					</p>

					<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
					<p>
						The modular design makes desogning responsively possivle and hels because the changes are consitent across the site.

                The process begins with taking inventory of existing content and assessing organizational goals to drive the redesign. 
              </p>
              <p>
                High level goals are reflected in the site’s structure, design and content strategy. Motivating priorities include engaging members, encouraging donations and educating and informing the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                The front page is updated with featured issues and promoted posts. Current issues engage visitors while showing CAPR’s activism. A more in depth introduction to the organization is also included on the Front page and About page. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="large-6 end columns">
              <p>
                CAPR is a nonprofit organization supported through donations. Ways to donate are featured prominently throughout the site with obvious vibrant buttons. The Support page shows permanent funds and highlights causes in need of support. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Chapters across the US make up CAPR. Local chapters have separate pages devoted to issues in their local area. Local chapters are also featured on the Chapter page. Visitors can locate a nearby chapter and find information on how to start a new group.

					<h3>Integrated Design System</h3>
					<p>Talk about initial setup, I used a starter theme that integrates the two.</p>
					<p>Describe whats happening. A senatance about how changes to Pattern Lab update acrsoos the entire site.</p>
					<p>Maintainability(better word??) -- A huge win is going to be making the site way more maintainable, since numerous designers contribute to the site and there are plans to integrate other parts of the site that are maintained separatly.</p>

					<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p>Summarize performace updates that came with updating to Drupal 8.</p>
					<p>Say it was built on Drupal 7 before but wanted a lot of the gains including the performance gains (and then summarize them).</p>
					<p>Are there any metrics you want to include or maybe another screenshot (use the google chrome screenshot??)</p>

					<em>Prolly too much bu think about listing modules I rely on??</em>

					<p>OK, for the picture, include a VS COde window, with a homepage.twig, region-footer.scss and the side panel open (cause the preprocessor automatically adds the support stuff, right? Double check the dev site for this</p>

							<h3>Create Once <br>Publish Everywhere</h3>
							<p>
								Creating content once and publishing in multiple places widely disseminates content without overly burdening the content creator. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Featured content is promoted from the blog interface. Custom summaries and featured images are added and the appropriate version of the post displays when featured.
							</p>
							<p>
								Managing content in one place eliminates the need to maintain multiple sets of content. Relevant posts are featured with minimal effort and searchable archives are preserved.  
							</p>
							<p>
								This approach also supports future plans for the site. Educational pages will draw on relevant items from blog posts and featured content. 
							</p>
							<h3>Roles</h3>
              <p>
								Members with different roles contribute and curate featured content. The content strategy engages contributors while allowing privileged users to curate highly visible content.
							</p>
              <p>
                To engage as many members as possible, adding content is straightforward for users with limited access. Most volunteers are given Contributor accounts. When creating content, their admin interface has limited options beyond tagging the post and adding a custom summary. Once published, the post appears on designated pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                A handful of trained users have advanced privileges, allowing them to promote posts and edit page content. Users with Editor accounts can promote any blog post, update page content and edit all content created by a Contributor. While Contributors provide a breadth of content, Editors strategically feature relevant content throughout the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specialty accounts also exist, restricting access to certain areas of the site or based on content ownership.
