								The theme enables designers, developers and clients to collaborate using reusable UI elements and centralized sources for easy modification across patterns. Interactive designs mean components are quickly optimized and tested for responsiveness, accessibility and performance.

						<h3>Modular Design</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Pattern Lab, an open-source tool for building UI design systems, relies on smaller design components combined to create page sections and templates.
							<p>
								The modular system reduces complexity while enforcing standardized styles, enabling designers and developers to effectively communicate and focus on optimization including accessibility and performance goals.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								Pattern Lab provides a way to describe the stitched together patterns so they can easily be referenced and updated. Reducing complexity ensures a maintainable and future-friendly system.
							</p>
							<p>
								Pattern Lab also provides ways to efficiently communicate with the client using interactive wireframes that integrate seamlessly into a component-based workflow.  Clients are able to interact with individual components and low-fidelity versions of final pages, supporting an iterative design process.

						<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Responsive websites focus on delivering thoughtful user experiences regardless of environment, bandwidth or specific user needs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Integrating Pattern Lab means designs move quickly to the browser and Drupal theme where they can be tested and optimized, supporting a mobile-first responsive approach.

							<h3>General intro about a progressive web app using the Vue framework.</h3>
							<p>
								Here's what a progressive web app is. And Vue is a framework, blah, blah.
							</p>
							<h3>Using Vue and D3 together</h3>
							<p>
								Quick intro about what D3 is and what I did with it in this case.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because Vue's reactivity is great, D3 was added so Vue's virtual DOM was relied on instead of D3's. Here's a quick wanlk through of what was fone. (Show it being added in a 'vuey' way through code sample, maybe.) 	
							</p>
							<h3>Progressive Enhncement</h3>
							<p>
								BTW, Vue is super supported all over so it's cool to use a framework for that reason.
							</p>
							<p>
								Used flexbox and did the following @support stuff so it's super compatible.
							</p>
							<h3>Modular Approach</h3>
							<p>
								Vue componnets and all that jazz.

						<h3>Create Once <br>Publish Everywhere</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Creating content once and publishing in multiple places disseminates content without overly burdening the creator.
							</p>
							<p>
								The content strategy informs the design system. Embracing a content-first approach, content and organizational goals are assessed during the planning phase to ensure the design approach addresses existing needs.</p>
							<p>
								Members with different roles contribute and curate featured content. The content strategy engages contributors while allowing privileged users to curate highly visible content. Based on the userâ€™s permissions, instructions and resources for managing content are shown.
							</p>
							<p>
								A custom content type provides the primary admin interface for contributing content including variations and associated media. Content is promoted across the site using the same interface. Managing content in one place reduces complexity while leveraging valuable contributions. Articles are promoted with minimal effort and searchable archives are preserved.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								Roles determine access to privileged features like promoting articles. The content strategy engages contributors while allowing privileged users to curate highly visible content.
							</p>
							<p>
								Custom admin interfaces are displayed based on an assigned role. To increase engagement, adding content for users with restricted access is straightforward. Users with advanced access are trained to navigate additional options allowing them to strategically feature articles and media throughout the site.
