                The front page is updated with featured issues and promoted posts. Current issues engage visitors while showing CAPR’s activism. A more in depth introduction to the organization is also included on the Front page and About page.

                The content strategy engages contributors while allowing privileged users to curate highly visible content.
              </p>
              <p>
                To engage as many members as possible, adding content is straightforward for users with limited access. Most volunteers are given Contributor accounts. When creating content, their admin interface has limited options beyond tagging the post and adding a custom summary. Once published, the post appears on designated pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                A handful of trained users have advanced privileges, allowing them to promote posts and edit page content. Users with Editor accounts can promote any blog post, update page content and edit all content created by a Contributor. While Contributors provide a breadth of content, Editors strategically feature relevant content throughout the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specialty accounts also exist, restricting access to certain areas of the site or based on content ownership.

                Creating content once and publishing in multiple places widely disseminates content without overly burdening the content creator. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Featured content is promoted from the blog interface. Custom summaries and featured images are added and the appropriate version of the post displays when featured.
              </p>
            </div>

                Managing content in one place eliminates the need to maintain multiple sets of content. Relevant posts are featured with minimal effort and searchable archives are preserved.  
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach also supports future plans for the site. Educational pages will draw on relevant items from blog posts and featured content.
