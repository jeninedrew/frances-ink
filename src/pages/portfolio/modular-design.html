						<h3>Modular Design</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Pattern Lab, an open-source tool for building UI design systems, relies on smaller design components that join to create page sections and templates.
							<p>
								The modular system reduces complexity while enforcing standardized styles, enabling designers and developers to effectively communicate and focus on optimization including accessibility and performance goals.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								Pattern Lab provides a way to describe the stitched together patterns so they can easily be referenced and updated. Reducing complexity ensures a maintainable and future-friendly system.
							</p>
							<p>
								Pattern Lab also provides ways to efficiently communicate with the client using interactive wireframes that integrate seamlessly into a component-based workflow.  Clients are able to interact with individual components and low-fidelity versions of final pages, supporting an iterative design process.

						<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Responsive websites focus on delivering thoughtful user experiences regardless of environment, bandwidth or specific user needs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Integrating Pattern Lab means designs move quickly to the browser and Drupal theme where they can be tested and optimized, supporting a mobile-first responsive approach.

						<h3>Integrated Design System</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								The theme is built on the <a href="https://github.com/forumone/gesso">Gesso</a> Drupal 8 starter theme which integrates <a href="https://github.com/forumone/starterkit-twig-drupal-gesso">a version of Pattern Lab</a>, automatically updating modified patterns across the site.
							</p>
							<p>
								Integrating Pattern Lab eliminates the need to maintain separate design systems, saving time and giving contributors immediate feedback.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								Drupal 8 improvements include a simplified theme layer and the introduction of the <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/">Twig</a> templating language. Gesso complies with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918">Drupal’s CSS best practices</a>, using <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> to organize styles. The theme follows the same standards for consistency and clarity. Together, Drupal 8 and Gesso provide a semantic and organized foundation.
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> compiles <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and watches Pattern Lab files for changes. Flexbox is used for layout.

						<h3>Create Once <br>Publish Everywhere</h3>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p class="intro">
								Creating content once and publishing in multiple places widely disseminates content without overly burdening the creator.
							</p>
							<p>
								After taking inventory of existing content and assessing organizational goals, a content strategy was created, informing the theme design. Featured content is promoted from the blog interface. Custom summaries and featured images are added and the appropriate version of the post displays when featured. Managing content in one place eliminates the need to maintain multiple sets of content. Relevant posts are featured with minimal effort and searchable archives are preserved.
							</p>
							<p>
								Members with different roles contribute and curate featured content. The content strategy engages contributors while allowing privileged users to curate highly visible content. Based on the user’s permissions, instructions and resources for managing content are shown. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="large-6 end columns">
							<p>
								To engage as many members as possible, adding content is straightforward for users with limited access. Most volunteers are given Contributor accounts. When creating content, their admin interface has limited options beyond tagging the post and adding a custom summary. Once published, the post appears on designated pages.
							</p>
							<p>
								A handful of trained users have advanced privileges, allowing them to promote posts and edit page content. Users with Editor accounts can promote any blog post, update page content and edit all content created by a Contributor. While Contributors provide the bulk of the of content, Editors strategically feature relevant articles and media throughout the site.
